# R Objects / Data Structure

* To make the best of the R language, you'll need a strong understanding of the
  basic data types and data structures and how to operate on those.

* **Very Important** to understand because these are the objects you will
  manipulate on a day-to-day basis in R. Dealing with object conversions is one
  of the most common sources of frustration for beginners.

* Everything in `R` is an object.

R has many different structures for storing the data you want to
analyze. The most commonly used are

* vectors
* lists
* matrices
* arrays
* data frames

It can be determined with the function `class()`.

The *type* or *mode* of an object defines how it is stored. It could
be

* a character,
* a numeric value,
* an integer,
* a complex number, or
* a logical value (Boolean value: TRUE/FALSE).

It can be determined with the function `typeof()`. `length()` informs you about
its size and `attributes()` if the object has any metadata associated to it.

| Example | Type |
| ------- | ---- |
| "a", "swc" | character |
| 2, 15.5 | numeric | 
| 2 (Must add a `L` at end to denote integer) | integer |
| `TRUE`, `FALSE` | logical |
| 1+4i | complex |


```{r}
x <- "dataset"
typeof(x)
attributes(x)

y <- 1:10
typeof(y)
length(y)

z <- c(1L, 2L, 3L)
typeof(z)
```

Below is a short definition  and quick example of each of these data
structures which you can use to decide which is the best for
representing your data in R.


### Vector
It is the most basic data type. Vectors only have one dimension and
all their elements must be the same mode. There are various ways to
create vectors. The simplest one is with the `c` function.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 5)
x
length(x)
```

`x` is a numeric vector. These are the most common kind. They are numeric
objects and are treated as double precision real numbers. To explicitly create
integers, add an `L` at the end.

```{r}
x1 <- c(1L, 2L, 5L)
```

You can also have logical vectors. 

```{r}
y <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
```

Finally you can have character vectors:

```{r}
z <- c("Holstein", "Brown Swiss", "Jersey")
```

The `c` function allows to combine its arguments. If the arguments
are of various modes, they will be reduced to their lowest common
type:

```{r}
x2 <- c(1, 3, "a")
x2
typeof(x2)
```

This is called implicit coercion. Objects can be explicitly coerced with the
`as.<class_name>` function.

```{r}
as.character(x1)
```

You can also use the `:` operator or the `seq` function:

```{r}
1:10
seq(from = 5, to = 25, by = 5)
```

**Other objects**

`Inf` is infinity. You can have either positive or negative infinity.

```{r}
1/0
1/Inf
```

`NaN` means Not a number. It's an undefined value.

```{r}
0/0
```

Each object can have attributes. Attributes can be part of an object of R. These
include: 

* names
* dimnames
* dim
* class
* attributes (contain metadata)


### Matrix
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. Technically, it is a
vector with two additional attributes: number of rows and number of
columns. This is what you would use to analyze a spreadsheet full of
only numbers, or only words. You can create a matrix with the `matrix`
function:

```{r}
m <- rbind(c(1, 4), c(2, 2))
m
m <- cbind(c(1, 4), c(2, 2))
m
dim(m)
m <- matrix(data = 1:12, nrow = 4, ncol = 3,
            dimnames = list(c("cow1", "cow2", "cow3", "cow4"),
                c("milk", "fat", "prot")))
m
```

Matrices are filled column-wise but you can also use the `byrow` argument to
specify how the matrix is filled.

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 4, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE,
            dimnames = list(c("cow1", "cow2", "cow3", "cow4"),
                c("milk", "fat", "prot")))
m
```


### List
A list is an ordered collection of objects where the objects can be of
different modes.

```{r}
l <- list("a", "b", "c", TRUE, 4)
```

Each element of a list can be given a name and referred to by that
name. Elements of a list can be accessed by their number or their name.

```{r}
cow <- list(breed = "Holstein", age = 3, last.prod = c(25, 35, 32))
cow$breed
cow[[1]]
```

Lists can be used to hold together multiple values returned from a
function. For example the elements used to create an histogram can be
saved and returned:

```{r hist}
h <- hist(islands)
str(h)
```

The function `str()` is used here. It stands for *structure* and shows
the internal structure of an R object.


### Factor
Factor is a special type of vector to store categorical values. They can be
ordered or unordered and are important for modelling functions such as
`lm()` and `glm()`, and also in plot methods.

Factors can only contain pre-defined values.

Factors are pretty much integers that have labels on them.  While factors look
(and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually integers under the
hood, and you need to be careful when treating them like strings. Some string
methods will coerce factors to strings, while others will throw an error.

Sometimes factors can be left unordered. Example: `male`, `female`.

Other times you might want factors to be ordered (or ranked). Example: `low`,
`medium`, `high`.

Underlying it is represented by numbers 1, 2, 3.

They are better than using simple integer labels because factors are what are
called self describing. `male` and `female` is more descriptive than `1`s and
`2`s. Helpful when there is no additional metadata.

Which is `male`? `1` or `2`? You wouldn't be able to tell with just integer
data. Factors have this information built in.

Factors can be created with `factor()`. Input is generally a character vector.

```{r}
breed <- factor(c("Holstein", "Holstein", "Brown Swiss", "Holstein",
                  "Ayrshire", "Canadian", "Canadian", "Brown Swiss",
                  "Holstein", "Brown Swiss", "Holstein"))
breed
```
It stores values as a set of labelled integers. Some functions treat
factors differently from numeric vectors.

```{r}
table(breed)
```

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, simply use

```{r}
as.character(breed)
```

In modelling functions, it is important to know what the baseline level is.
This is the first factor but by default the ordering is determined by
alphabetical order of words entered. You can change this by specifying the
levels (another option is to use the function `relevel()`).

```{r}
x <- factor(c("yes", "no", "yes"), levels = c("yes", "no"))
x
```


### Array
If a matrix is a two-dimensional data structure, we can add *layers*
to the data and have further dimensions in addition to rows and
columns. These datasets would be arrays. It can be
created with the `array` function:

```{r}
a <- array(data = 1:24, dim = c(3, 4, 2))
```


### Data frame
Data frames are used to store tabular data: multiple rows, columns and
format.

Data frames can have additional attributes such as `rownames()`, which can be
useful for annotating data, like subject_id or sample_id. But most of the time
they are not used.

Some additional information on data frames:

* Usually created by `read.csv()` and `read.table()`.

* Can convert to `matrix` with `data.matrix()`

* Coercion will be forced and not always what you expect.

* Can also create with `data.frame()` function.

* Find the number of rows and columns with `nrow(df)` and `ncol(df)`, respectively.

* Rownames are usually 1..n.


```{r}
df <- data.frame(cow = c("Moo-Moo", "Daisy", "Elsie"),
                 prod = c(35, 40, 28),
                 pregnant = c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
```

**Combining data frames**

```{r, eval = TRUE}
cbind(df, data.frame(z = 4))
```

When you combine column wise, only row numbers need to match. If you are adding
a vector, it will get repeated.

**Useful functions**

* `head()` - see first 6 rows
* `tail()` - see last 6 rows
* `dim()` - see dimensions
* `nrow()` - number of rows
* `ncol()` - number of columns
* `str()` - structure of each column
* `names()` - will list the `names` attribute for a data frame (or any object
  really), which gives the column names.

A data frame is a special type of list where every element of the list has same
length.

See that it is actually a special list:

```{r}
is.list(df)
class(df)
```

### Missing values

Denoted by `NA` and/or `NaN` for undefined mathematical operations.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
is.na()
is.nan()
```

Check for both.

NA values have a class. So you can have both an integer NA (`NA_integer_`) and a
character NA (`NA_character_`).

`NaN` is also `NA`. But not the other way around.

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)
x
```

```{r}
is.na(x)  # returns logical
# shows third
is.nan(x)
# none are NaN
```

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, NaN, 4, 5)
is.na(x)
# shows 2 TRUE
is.nan(x)
# shows 1 TRUE
```

### Exercise 1

Import the [health](health.csv) dataset. This dataset presents the lactations of
500 cows from various herds, providing age, lactation number, presence of milk
fever (`mf`) and/or displaced abomasum (`da`) coded as 0/1. Have a look at the
different variables. What type are they? Would you like to convert any of them
to a factor variable? How would you do it? How would you create a variable `parity`
categorizing `lactation` into the categories 1, 2+ (hint: see `?cut`)? check
that it creates factors.

### Solution

```{r import-health}
health <- read.csv(
    file = "health.csv",
    header = TRUE,
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

str(health)
health$presence <- factor(health$presence, labels = c("No", "Yes"))
health$parity <- cut(health$lactation,
                     breaks = c(0, 1, max(health$lactation)),
                     labels = c("1", "2+"))
```

### Exercise 2

Three hundred and thirty-three cows are milked by a milker wearing gloves and
280 by a milker not wearing gloves. Two hundred cows in each group developed a
mastitis. Create the following table and perform a chi-squared test (hint:
`chisq.test`).

|           | Mastitis | No mastitis |
|:---------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
| Gloves    |: 200    :|: 133       :|
| No gloves |: 200    :|: 80        :|

### Solution

```{r}
tab <- rbind(c(200, 133), c(200, 80))
rownames(tab) <- c("Gloves", "No gloves")
colnames(tab) <- c("Mastitis", "No mastitis")
tab
chisq.test(tab)
```
